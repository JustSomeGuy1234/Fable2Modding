The stuff in here is old and probably shouldn't be used.

# Fable2 bnk.bms
A bad QuickBMS script I wrote that extracts files from most bnk archives, except the big ones.
The input (bnk) file to extract from MUST be in the same directory as the output folder. Sorry 'bout that.

This QuickBMS script does actually have a use. BNKExplorer can't open scripts from gamescripts_r.lua for some reason.
This script can extract all but four of them:
  gameflow.lua which already exists as plaintext
  qc010_childhood.lua
  qc130_thecampinitation.lua
  qc200_blootstoneassault.lua
You should probably just substitue these scripts with the ones from gamescripts anyway.
