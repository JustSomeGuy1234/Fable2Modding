-- List of Fable 2 Lua table/functions compiled by Just Some Guy - https://github.com/JustSomeGuy1234/
-- This is NOT every single function/table, only the ones that I found interesting out of those that I found.
-- "TableName." means it's a table. If there's no . after a line it means it's most very likely a function.
-- Functions below a table indicate that they're within the previously specified table.
-- For example:
--        Debug. 
--        ToggleFreeCam
--        SetDrawDebugPage
-- Means that ToggleFreeCam and SetDrawDebugPage are both within the Debug table, and can be called with Debug.ToggleFreeCam() and Debug.SetDrawDebugPage()
-- Another thing is that backslashes indicate that i've basically abbreviated two or more functions into one.
-- For example:
-- Remove/AddOutlineForLineFiring means RemoveOutlineForLineFiring AND AddOutlineForLineFiring exist
-- Use your common sense to decypher what I've written

-- I do not know what every single one of these functions do, though the majority of them are self explanatory such as Debug.ToggleFreeCam()
-- If you find a function and you don't know how to use it or what it does, try and find it within one of the game's Lua scripts. 
-- It may not necessarily be used by anything, in which case you'll have to blindly figure it out which may involve a LOT of trial and error and crashing.

-- Once again, this is by no means a complete list and I've left out many many functions that I have no interest in, or I left out due to ignorance, or I simply didn't find them.
-- I hand typed all of these because the game has been stripped of it's io table, which is not surprising because it's a game on the Xbox 360.
-- There very well may be errors.

-- To find functions/tables on your own, you can pass GUI.DisplayMessageBox() the first few tostring()'d results of pairs() that has been passed table.
-- Check the guide for a function I wrote that converts every key in a table to a string and displays them on screen, 12 keys at a time. It's what I used to find this stuff.

Several enemy/friend related things. Can we do something a little evil and set the faction of a friendly?

SearchTools.FilterWithName("entnamehere", name) -- FilterWith...
SearchTools.GetSearchResults(search) -- Returns table, first result is key 1.

EnvironmentTheme.
BlendToEnvironmentTheme("EnvThemeChildhoodNight", 1, 0) -- Theme, intensity (0 disables), time to change. I wish I had a list of em, there's the environmentthemes gdb but I can't reverse that. I'll have to go through all quest scripts and find em.
SetOverrideBlending(true)
SetColourParameter("MAIN_LIGHT_COLOUR", 0, 0, 0) -- Alternatively -- "LIGHTMAP_COLOUR" / "AMBIENT_COLOUR" / Probably more


GDB. -- Finding everything in the GDB would be great, but I can't reverse the GDB file so it's basically impossible to find what i'd be looking for without already knowing what it is.
GetRecord
RecordExists
RecordExistsInGlobalDatabase


Carrying. -- Some of these exist in utils.lua. 
          -- Contains lots of funcs that get things that're being carried, including things the hero is holding. (See onactionusepullpint.lua for an actual application)
------Example------
local jug = Debug.CreateEntityAt("ObjectFurnitureDynamicPitcher", "Pitcher", CVector3(0, 0, 0))
Carrying.PutEntityInSlot(GetPlayerHero(), DummyObjects.HAND_RIGHT, jug)

SetTimeAsStopped -- Probably stops day cycle. Seems to return number of calls or something... but I didn't call this over 200 times.
GetSecondsSince
Set/GetWorldSecondsPerSecond -- Also sets time speed, much like Debug.SetPlayerSecondsPerSecond(). Debug func could just be a proxy. Cool for slowmo.
Set/GetDaySpeed -- 1440 by default. Comes out to an hour a minute, I think.
Wait -- I believe this pauses a coroutine.
GetTickRate -- 15. Unfortunately there's no setter.
FastForwardTimeOfDayTo -- Haven't tried outside of childhood.

Decapitatable.
Decapitate -- poggers. Works but doesn't kill entity. Pass target and hero.

IsDecapitated

Mentalist. -- suicide hobbes
ExtinguishFuse
GoBoom
IsLit
LightFuse
GetECType -- Could use this to figure out what the hell this is.

SetAsAlwaysInView -- ? Prevents object alpha from changing?
SetSaturationMask -- ? Crashes if passed a bool. Requires reference to ent or camera?
DebugSetAsChanged -- ? 
HasDummyObject(ent, dummyobject) -- Pretty sure a dummy object is a bone, or a point on an object. Check DummyObjects table for a few of em. Doesn't contain all as evident by usepullpint.
GetNumDummyObjects
GetDummyObjectPosition(self.ItemBeingUsed, "Prop.Action.Serve.Customer", 0) -- So i'm pretty sure it's ent, dummy object, unknown. Looks like you can either pass this a dummyobject from the table, or a string. Maybe the string var is used to search in the level for it.

Age. -- Also contains things about "age group".
GetAge
SetAge
SetAgeLimit

Morph.
SetPinkEye -- Can't see a different but it does seem to do something
